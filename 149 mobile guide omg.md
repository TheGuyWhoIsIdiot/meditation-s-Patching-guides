# Ok, many people are getting problems with that patching android/ios
[android patching guid](https://github.com/TheGuyWhoIsIdiot/meditation-s-Patching-guides/blob/main/android%20patch.md) Android patching guide (including public key patching.)

After you patch the client, if are you getting 149 error joining to your rcc, you need to add the version.

**Also, if are you using 2017E (version 280) or less, you will need to do this**
"INTERNALandroidapp","INTERNAiosapp" _(Put these lines of code for GetAllowedSecurityVersions)_

After all, the version check works like this: 7 first version numbers (example: 2.271.9, 2.205.5) androidapp (for android, obvious) or iosapp (ios lol)

here is a example:
""2.271.9androidapp"", ""2.271.9iosapp"" **(notice that version numbers can probably be different than android or ios)**

_P.S: If using double quotes doesnt work for you, in ios or android, just remove the double quotes and put only 2 quotes ("x.xxx.xandroidapp")_
## If are you running rcc, Please reset your gameserver to get it working, or else it will not work

# CREDIT ME AFTER USING THAT OR RAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜±ðŸ’¢
