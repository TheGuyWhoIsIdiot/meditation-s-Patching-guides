# OwO.
No one did a patching guide for the boblocks installr but feel welcome.

# How to patch boblocks launchr
you need:
- x32dbg (you can do without it)
- hxd. (if you have 1K iq ðŸ§ )
- resource hacker.

# first step my bois
go to x32dbg and open the file
(prob everyone knows how to replace strings.)
string search "roblox.com" (if you dont do that, you can get a pontential massive "updating" shit)
replace all of them to your domain (or you can do the push address trick to have longer domain names lmfao)
after that, string search "roblox-player", and replace it to your uri name (e.g. rblx15-player, limrev-player)

# add support to have roblocks with your revival.
This is **crucial**, cus we have roblocks playerz and no one likes uninstalling roblocks to play your revival.
String search "RobloxReg" and replace to anything (LimrevReg for example)
ALSO YOU NEED TO CHANGE "ROBLOX Corporation" TOO.

alr, string search "\Roblox" and replace it to your revival name (same applies for the string trick ðŸ˜Ž if you know how to do lmao)
do that correctly or else you will get fucked up results.

# Second step.
apply the patches and you will get results.
After all, open resource hackr 10005 machine, and go to string tables.

Replace roblox.com to yours.
